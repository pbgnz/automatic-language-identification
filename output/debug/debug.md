## debug

The program generates debug files for each sentence in the test set.

A sample debug file looks like: `1-bigramFR-fr-vingt-mille-lieues-sous-les-mers.txt`

The `1` stands for the sentence number in the test file   
The `bigramFR` stands for the model used to predict the sentence   
The `fr-vingt-mille-lieues-sous-les-mers.txt` stands for the corpus used to train the model
